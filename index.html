<h1>New York City police misconduct tends to accompany higher rates of misdemeanors</h1>

<h4>Made possible by the repeal of a decades-old law, a deep-dive into the New York City’s Civilian Complaint Review Board records shows a correlation between the NYPD precincts with the highest crime rate and the greatest amount of police misconduct.</h4>

<p>Last month the Legal Aid Society launched the <a href="https://legalaidnyc.org/law-enforcement-look-up/">NYC Law Enforcement Look-Up</a>, a ‘one-stop-shop’ database which compiles New York Police Department misconduct records across city agencies, including records maintained by the CCRB.</p> 

<p>Years in the making, the database is possible thanks to state legislators' <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-york-state-legislature-votes-repeal-law-50-shields-police-scrunity">2020 repeal of 50-A</a>, a law which for 44 years shielded police departments across New York from releasing most disciplinary records.</p>

<p>Comparing the amount of substantiated complaints of police misconduct in every NYC precinct with <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page">historic crime data from the NYPD</a> showing the number of misdemeanors issued over the past decade, the precincts with the highest amount of complaints tended to also have higher crime levels.</p>

<p><strong>Out of 74 precincts, the top 10 with the most complaints made up 20 percent of all misdemeanors.</strong></p>

<p>“It doesn’t surprise me one bit,” said Abdul Nasser Rad, the managing director of research and data at the nonprofit Campaign Zero.</p>

<p>“The areas with most historical disinvestment is where there’s most police interactions, and wherever there’s the most police interactions that’s where all the police misconduct is going to be.”</p>

<p>Nasser Rad added that if the precincts were further divided by socio-economic factors "that are highly correlated with historical disinvestment, you’ll probably see that it also relates to similar levels of complaints” relative to misdemeanors.
